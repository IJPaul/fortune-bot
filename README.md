# fortune-bot

Code for a Twitter bot that tweets fortunes generated via a python program daily. My Twitter developer API specific information has been omitted for security reasons.

Give the bot a follow at https://twitter.com/FortuneCookie50 for some good fortune!

This bot utilizes the twitter API in combination with the python module python-twitter
The documentation for this module can be found here: https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

This bot requires a cron object to be created so that tweets are tweeted out automatically once daily (at midnight).

The concept of a fortune cookie bot has been done before. This is simply a fun project practicing web-scraping and learning about the Twitter API.
